# Cal.com Integration Debugging - Fixed

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Multiple Script Loading Conflicts**
- **Problem**: When clicking different service buttons, multiple Cal.com scripts were loading and conflicting
- **Solution**: Implemented global script loading management to ensure Cal.com script loads only once

### 2. **Orange Button Disappearing**
- **Problem**: Main booking button disappeared when inline booking was shown
- **Solution**: 
  - Added toggle functionality to service buttons
  - Added close button (X) to inline booking widget
  - Show main booking button below inline widget as alternative

### 3. **Buttons Stuck Loading**
- **Problem**: Service buttons kept loading without response
- **Solution**: Fixed component lifecycle and added proper error handling

## Applied Fixes

### BookingIntegration.tsx
- Added global script loading flags to prevent duplicate loads
- Implemented promise-based loading to handle concurrent widget instances
- Added unique widget IDs to prevent conflicts between multiple instances
- Fixed missing useEffect closing bracket

### booking/page.tsx
- Added `handleCloseInlineBooking` function
- Implemented toggle behavior for service buttons
- Added close button to inline booking card
- Keep main booking button visible as alternative option

## Testing Steps

1. **Restart the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache and reload the page**

3. **Test the booking functionality**:
   - Click the orange "Prenota Appuntamento" button - should open popup
   - Click any service button - should show inline booking below
   - Click the X button on inline booking - should close it
   - Click same service button again - should toggle the inline booking
   - Switch between different services - should update the inline widget

## Console Logs to Check

Open browser console (F12) and look for:
- "Cal.com script already loaded" - when switching services
- "Loading Cal.com script for the first time" - on first load
- "Cal.com Debug:" messages showing the current state

## If Issues Persist

1. Check if `.env.local` has correct Cal.com credentials:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CAL_USERNAME=your-username
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CAL_LINK=your-username
   ```

2. Verify Cal.com account has event types configured

3. Check browser console for any error messages

4. Try in incognito/private browsing mode

✅ Script loading conflicts resolved
✅ Button state management fixed
✅ Multiple widget instances handled
